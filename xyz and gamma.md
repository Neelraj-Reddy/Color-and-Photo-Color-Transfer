### **1. What is XYZ Color Space?**
The **CIE 1931 XYZ color space** is a color representation model defined by the **International Commission on Illumination (CIE)**. It serves as an **intermediate color space** used in color conversions, particularly between device-dependent spaces like **RGB** and perceptually uniform spaces like **LAB**.

#### **Why is XYZ Important?**
- It is **device-independent**, meaning it represents colors in a standardized way.
- It serves as a **bridge between different color spaces** (e.g., RGB ↔ XYZ ↔ LAB).
- The **Y component represents luminance (brightness)**, making it useful in color perception models.

#### **How is XYZ Computed from RGB?**
To convert from **sRGB (standard RGB) to XYZ**, we use a **transformation matrix**:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0.4124564 & 0.3575761 & 0.1804375 \\
0.2126729 & 0.7151522 & 0.0721750 \\
0.0193339 & 0.1191920 & 0.9503041
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
R' \\
G' \\
B'
\end{bmatrix}
\]

where **R', G', B'** are the **linearized** RGB values (i.e., after gamma correction).

### **2. What is Gamma Correction?**
Gamma correction is a process used to adjust the brightness and contrast of an image. It **corrects the non-linear response of display screens** and **improves color accuracy**.

#### **Why is Gamma Correction Needed?**
- The human eye perceives brightness **non-linearly** (we are more sensitive to dark tones than bright ones).
- Screens (LCDs, LEDs) and cameras **do not linearly capture or display light intensity**.
- Without gamma correction, images would appear **too dark or too bright**.

#### **How is Gamma Correction Applied?**
When working with **sRGB (standard RGB)**, we need to **convert it to a linear space** before further processing.

##### **Gamma Expansion (sRGB → Linear RGB)**
Before transforming to XYZ, we need to **remove gamma compression** from RGB values using this formula:

\[
R' = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{R}{12.92}, & \text{if } R \leq 0.04045 \\
\left(\frac{R + 0.055}{1.055}\right)^{2.4}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

(Same formula applies for **G'** and **B'**)

##### **Gamma Compression (Linear RGB → sRGB)**
After processing (like converting XYZ back to RGB), we **reapply gamma correction**:

\[
R =
\begin{cases}
12.92 \cdot R', & \text{if } R' \leq 0.0031308 \\
1.055 \cdot R'^{(1/2.4)} - 0.055, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

---
### **3. Summary**
- **XYZ is an absolute color space** used as an intermediate step in color transformations.
- **Gamma correction is required** to convert between RGB and XYZ because RGB is typically stored in a **gamma-compressed** form.
- **When converting from RGB → XYZ**, we must first **remove gamma correction**.
- **When converting from XYZ → RGB**, we must **apply gamma correction** back to ensure proper display.
